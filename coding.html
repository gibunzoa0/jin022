    <p>Will Samsung compromise on the camera function of its newest 
        <strong> <u><a href="https://n.news.naver.com/article/640/0000048087"
            target="_blank" title="뉴스링크">S24 smartphone</a></u></strong> lineup?</p>
The upcoming flagship smartphone is expected to pack a number of exciting features including simultaneous phone call translations. 
<br>But one critical aspect may see a downgrade: the camera. 
With just two weeks remaining before Samsung's Unpacked launch event, scheduled for Jan.<br> 17 in San Jose, California, the rumors are swirling in full force. 
<br>Walmart mistakenly uploaded a “Galaxy S24 Plus” item to its website, revealing various specs about the model, which was soon deleted.
<br> But one of the most recent leaks indicates that the S24 Ultra — the series' 
<br>top model — will not be topped with an 10x optical zoom lens as its predecessor, the Galaxy S23 Ultra, was.
 <p>The 10x periscope lens is expected to be replaced with a 5x telephoto lens.</p>
The Galaxy S23 Ultra's camera was widely praised as one of the best on the market. Its 10x optical zoom lens, including the 100X “Space Zoom” function, utilized its own patented technology and allowed the close-up recording of events including Taylor Swift concerts.
